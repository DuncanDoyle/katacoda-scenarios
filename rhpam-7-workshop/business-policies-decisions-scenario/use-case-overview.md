# Use Case Overview

The requirements that are handed to you:
These requirements are the policies of Pecunia Corp. to handle a credit card transaction.


## Requirements

The cost of processing a credit card dispute is very high, and also critical from the customer experience perspective. Usually the credit card holder is stressed to protect the assets trusted to the bank. One of the most critical aspects of the interaction with the dispute system is the constant feedback to the customer, i.e. the system and the process for disputing a transaction has to constantly inform the credit card holder on the status of the dispute. E.g., what is currently happening with the dispute, is additional information from the customer required, has the dispute been automatically accepted, has something gone wrong with the dispute, etc.
These are all considerations that need to be taken into account when automating the process.

-----------------

### Business:

A risk assessment must be performed based on the customer's profile, the type of dispute, and the amount. This could lead to automatic processing of the dispute or to a manual approval step to solve the dispute.

We define 2 sets of rules, one set that determines whether the dispute can be qualified for automated chargeback, and a set that determines the risk of the dispute.

The requirement for automatic chargeback qualification is:

- _Automatic processing is only available to customers with a Gold or Platinum status._

The risk of the transaction is determined by the status of customer and the amount of the dispute:

- _For a standard customer, and a dispute amount between 0 and 100, the risk is low._
- _For a standard customer, and a dispute amount between 100 and 500, the risk is medium_
- _For a standard customer, and a dispute amount above 500, the risk is high._
- _For a silver customer, and a dispute amount below 250, the risk is low._
- _For a silver customer, and a dispute amount between 250 and 500, the risk is medium._
- _For a silver customer, and a dispute amount above 500, the risk is high._
- _For a gold customer, and a dispute amount below 500, the risk is low._
- _For a gold customer, and a dispute amount over 500, the risk is medium._

The type of security questions that the customers needs to answer depend on the merchant and the use case, this is very important as some of the information is necessary for the Payment gateway to process the refund or chargeback with the merchant. These questions are also susceptible to continuous change, as the regulations may change with short notice. And, as new type of credit card products come out this also need to be updated and maintained by the business user.
