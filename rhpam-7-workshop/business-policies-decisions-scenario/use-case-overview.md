## REQUIREMENTS

The cost of processing a credit card dispute is very high, and also very critical from the customer experience perspective, usually the credit card holder is stressed to protect the assets trusted to the bank, one of the most critical aspects of the interaction with the system is the constant feedback to the customer, the system and the process for disputing a transaction has to constantly tell the credit card holder what is happening with the dispute, if something is needed from him, what is the current status, if something has gone wrong, etc.
This are all considerations that need to be taken into account when automating the process.
