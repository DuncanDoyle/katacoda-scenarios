Now that we have a report page defined, we need to make it accessible from the workbench.

1. Go to *Menu* -> *Design* -> *Pages* and click on the *Navigation* button on the left-hand side of the screen.
2. Expand the *Workbench* menu. Observe that the entries define the navigation menus in the Business Central workbench: *Design*, *Deploy*, *Manage* and *Track*.
3. Hoover over the *Track* menu item, click on the gear-icon and click on *+ New Page*.
4. Select the *incidents-reports* and click on the check-icon.
5. Click on the *Save* button in the *Save changes?* panel on the left of the screen.
6. Open the reporting page via *Menu* -> *Track* -> *incidents-report*.
